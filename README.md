# OSMT
Open-Source Meme Toolkit - Utilize free/libre resources for creating memes.

## What is OSMT?
OSMT (Open-Source Meme Toolkit) is a list of resources such as free-as-in-freedom fonts, open source utilities, and other things that are either in the public domain or are free to use for creating memes.

## Why?
I came up with the idea while browsing r/linuxmemes. "What if you could make a meme that is entirley based upon almost entirley free materials, like free and open source software?" 

## Well, where's the material?
Below is the material. The format showcasing the material goes in a certain way:

License - Name of Material - Description - Link to homepage for said material

### Fonts
NOTE: The OFL includes 2 documents, first is the license, the second is the FAQ. The FAQ mentions that the font name and author do not need to be credited in materials such as published texts and the like, and by inferred extension, memes.


OFL - League Gothic - Impact-like font - https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic

OFL - Anton - Impact-like font - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton


### Image Processing Applications
GPLv3+ - GNU Image Manipulation Program - Free/Libre image editor with many tools included - https://gimp.org/
