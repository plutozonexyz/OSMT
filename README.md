# OSMT
Open-Source Meme Toolkit - Utilize free/libre resources for creating memes.

## What is OSMT?
OSMT (Open-Source Meme Toolkit) is a list of resources such as free-as-in-freedom fonts, open source utilities, and other things that are either in the public domain or are free to use for creating memes.

## Why?
I came up with the idea while browsing r/linuxmemes. "What if you could make a meme that is entirley based upon almost entirley free materials, like free and open source software?" 

## Well, where's the material?
This repository was just made. More material will be added soon.
