# OSMT
Open-Source Meme Toolkit - Utilize free/libre resources for creating memes.

## What is OSMT?
OSMT (Open-Source Meme Toolkit) is a list of resources such as free-as-in-freedom fonts, open source utilities, and other things that are either in the public domain or are free to use for creating memes.

## Why?
I came up with the idea while browsing r/linuxmemes. "What if you could make a meme that is entirley based upon almost entirley free materials, like free and open source software?" 

Though it's practically impossible to create a meme through completley open components which are either licensed under libre licenses or are in the public domain, it's fun to see how far you can get with making it as "free" as possible.

## Definitions of the Types of Memes
There are certain types of memes that can vary on the level of openness it posseses.

Proprietary Memes - These contain not only the center of the joke being from a copyrighted movie or image or something of the likes, but it also includes proprietary fonts like Impact and was most likely created using a closed-source "meme generator".

Proprietary with Libre Components - These types may vary, but they typically are created using a FOSS image manipulator like GIMP, and can contain free-as-in-freedom fonts like the ones mentioned.

Full-on Libre - This means that the meme was created using free fonts, a non-proprietary image creator, a royalty-free/public-domain centerpiece, and other components like if the image is distributed under, let's say, a Creative Commons license.


## Well, where's the material?
Below is the material. The format showcasing the material goes in a certain way:

License - Name of Material - Description - Link to homepage for said material

### Fonts
NOTE: The OFL includes 2 documents, first is the license, the second is the FAQ. The FAQ mentions that the font name and author do not need to be credited in materials such as published texts and the like, and by inferred extension, memes.


OFL - League Gothic - Impact-like font - https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic

OFL - Anton - Impact-like font - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton

OFL - Lato - Arial-like font for more "modern" memes - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato

### Image Processing Applications
GPLv3+ - GNU Image Manipulation Program - Free/Libre image editor with many tools included - https://gimp.org/

## Public-Domain Images
Many under CC0 - Free Images - Millions of public domain stock images and clipart - https://free-images.com/

### Licenses
You can most likely use any license, though some may use a poor choice of words considering that most are targeted towards software and not "works of art". Therefore I reccomend the Creative Commons license maker, in which you can specify certain parts of the license and then you can put the small Creative Commons license watermark onto the corner of the image or anywhere else. It is also reccomended to put a username as a second watermark so you may claim your work if it is truly libre and contains no copyrighted components.


## The rest?
This repository was just made recently. More materials and info may be added soon.
